# The Drab: Style Guide
*Style guide for writers and contributors*


## Formatting

### Interviews

"The Drab" should be used as the attribution unless it is between a) writers or b) requires a name for comic effect. For example a divisive character such as Victory Wigbert might want to be reinforced as speaking before being told to fuck off.

The Drab's lines should be fully emboldened. All other lines only the attribution and colon should be in bold.

A two new lines should be used for each new line.

**The Drab: So tell me what happened.**

**Student A:** It was absolutely incredible, I was just over half way through taking notes on the slide, and our lecturer had almost finished reading everything out, then he just... waited? He stood there for a good few minutes waiting for us to write everything down.

**The Drab: Wow, that's unheard of, did he just stand there in silence or?**

**Student B:** Well he stood there for a bit and then he said 'there's no rush, I've actually planned my lecture so I have the right amount of content'.
